# About Us

Camden Philharmonia Orchestra is a friendly and dynamic amateur orchestra that tackles diverse and exciting repertoire and performs three concerts a year. We rehearse weekly in Central London, and look forward to welcoming new members looking for a social orchestra with a passion for classical music.

The emphasis is, no matter how good the orchestra is or the players are individually, we strive to be a better ensemble with the instruction of the very talented and accessible conductor, Liz Worth.

Based on a Classical Orchestra scoring, CPO comprises wind, strings and brass. We perform three times a year, each following a ten-week term of rehearsals. The format of the concerts is typically Overture-Concerto-Symphony, collaborating with soloists of international repute.

We play some fantastic repertoire including many iconic pieces, such as Violin concertos by Mendelssohn, Beethoven, Bruch and Brahms; Piano concertos by Rachmaninov, Grieg, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Shostakovich; Cello concertos by Elgar and Tchaikovsky, and choral pieces from Don Giovanni exerpts to Nessun Dorma. Symphonies and overtures are mainly taken from the Classical and Romantic periods, though we have also delved into Baroque and 20th Century too. See here for a full list of repertoire we have performed so far.

Camden Philharmonia Orchestra is listed as one of the central London orchestras on amateurorchestras.org.uk, a list of amateur orchestras by region.  We believe our orchestra is the best amateur orchestra in London. But donâ€™t take our word for it. If you are looking to join a London orchestra then come and see for yourself.
