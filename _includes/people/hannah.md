Hannah started playing the violin at a young age and after receiving a music scholarship to study at St George’s College, Weybridge on violin, piano and singing, her career was off to a busy start.

Following 4 years at the University of Leeds and a year at Conservatorio di Verona “Evaristo Felice Dall’Abaco”, Italy, she was awarded the Alan Tregonning Scholarship to study a Masters of Music at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Drama where she is studying with renowned violist Rivka Golani.

Alongside her studies, Hannah is found recording and playing with many artists and ensembles with whom she plays a range of genres from film scores and musical theatre to pop and Ibiza club classics, as well as Bach ensembles and Classical symphony orchestras.

Hannah enjoys working on many projects including Animate Orchestra with Sarah Freestone, running Music Time for Under Fives in nurseries around London and is looking forward to a collaboration involving Virtual Reality to come out soon.
