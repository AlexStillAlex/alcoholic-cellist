# Joining Us

We attract a diverse set of players of various ages and walks of life. Whilst we have several music college graduates in our midst, others among us simply missed playing in an orchestra from our school or university days.

However, we all have one thing in common: a passion for music making.

If you want to make great music with talented players and soloists then please contact us.

We don’t do anything as stressful or finite as auditions but prefer for you to come along to a few rehearsals to see what it is like. If you are grade 7+ standard you should fit right in.

If after a few rehearsals you decide it is for you, what you will get is eight or nine orchestra rehearsals, one or two sectional rehearsals, a dress rehearsal and a concert all over an eleven-week period.  All of these will be under the guidance of a professional conductor and a professional orchestra leader.  That equates as up to 25 hours of playing for the following membership price:

Students / Pensioners / Unemployed: £60 (£2.40 per hour equivalent*)

Standard: £90 (£3.60 per hour equivalent*)

* Membership price is a flat fee per term.  The equivalent hourly rate is provided as an illustration assuming you attend all rehearsals and the concert.
